## ü´µ Who is this library for
I have developed this library for cases where you need to launch a large number of tasks without stopping. When you need to do a lot of action in parallel and on a competitive basis in a timely manner. I used this library where I had to grab the site pages at the same time once a minute and it proved to be stable.
<br> In which projects it will be perform best‚ùì<br>
- If you need to grab a site pages without stopping <br>
- If you need to get price quotes from exchanges for a large count of shares by API
- And in many other projects where you have to do something on time, in large quantities and with a certain frequency

### ‚úèÔ∏è Examples <a id="examples" />

**Use flow**

FabulousScheduler uses a builder pattern that allows you to conveniently create a cron or queue jobs for executing

```csharp
using FabulousScheduler.Cron;

// Init CronJobManager with default config
CronJobManager.Init();

// Register callback for job's result
CronJobManager.CallbackEvent += result =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("[{0:hh:mm:ss}] jobID: {1} IsSuccess: {2}", DateTime.Now, result.Id, result.IsSuccess, result.IsFail);
};

// Registe the job
CronJobManager.Register(
    action: () =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine();
        throw new Exception("some err");
    },
    sleepDuration: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1) 
);
// The job will fall asleep for 1 second after  success completion, then it will wake up and will be push the job pool

Thread.Sleep(-1);
```

**Cache**
```csharp

```
